## 📖 Project Description
✨ Problem Statement:In today’s healthcare system, prescription errors, fake medical reports, and delayed diagnosis from scans like X-rays and ECGs often put patients at serious risk. Many people struggle to understand complex medical data, while doctors face high workloads and limited time for analysis. There is a need for a reliable AI-based system that can verify prescriptions, analyze medical scans, and simplify reports to improve accuracy, safety, and trust in healthcare.

💡 Proposed Solution:MediVerify AI is an intelligent platform that verifies prescriptions, analyzes medical scans, and delivers easy-to-understand reports. It assists doctors with AI-driven insights, ensures patient safety, and securely manages data on the Microsoft Azure cloud.

🎯 **Target Users / Use Cases:SwasthyaSense is designed for doctors, hospitals, pharmacists, and patients, ensuring accurate prescriptions, faster diagnosis, and safer healthcare for all.
